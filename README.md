This is the Jetpack-Bugzilla-Organizer add-on.  It adds a widget to the browser which opens a panel that presents the user with three options: General, Documentation, and Builder.
If the user clicks one of the options, it will open a tab to a page that pulls in all open bugs from that product/component. The page analyzes the incoming bugs based on when they were created and last modified.
