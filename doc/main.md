The main module is a program that creates a widget.  When a user clicks on
the widget, a panel is opened with three options. Each of the options opens a tab which categorizes all open bugs from that component/product, and categorizes them by when they were last modified.
Each category can be sorted by bug number, bug priority, or the assignee. (And the sort can be reversed when sorted again.)
